obligations until after Fall Break.

One class begins we will meet during Programming Practicum's typical timeslot:
4:15 - 5:30, Tuesdays, in Shanahan 3460. There will also be frequent office/lab

# Potential Presentation Topics

   1. Debugging Memory Errors in Rust (Assignment 1, Bonus C). --Adam
   2. `replace_with` -- this turned into part of the "unsafe" assignmnent.
   3. Doubly-linked lists and the Rust ownership model.
   4. What exactly are `Fn`, `FnOnce`, `FnMut`? Function types, Closure types,
      and function traits in Rust. --Zach
   5. Macros --Eric
   6. Anonymous lifetimes in Rust: Elision versus anonymity.
   7. Writing (and explaining) a safe Rust program which leaks memory --Max and
      Daniel
   8. Type System Abuse: Compile Time Arithmetic in Rust
   9. `Sized`: Sized and unsized types in Rust. (Also super cool) --Michael and
      Jackson
   10. Dereference coercions & partial moves --Ross and Luis
   11. Allocators. How can one go about allocating memory in (unsafe) Rust?  --Julien and Dan
   12. [`crossbeam`][crossbeam]: aturon's scoped thread library.
      * You know how threads require `'static` inputs? What if they didn't?
   13. Single Entry Multiple Exit/Static Single Assignment/Dominators take on Non-Lexical Lifetimes.
   14. Associated Type Constructors.
   15. Garbage collection traits.
